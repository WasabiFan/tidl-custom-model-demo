# TIDL custom model experiments

Work-in-progress scripts and tools to get a custom model compiled with TIDL and running on the
TDA4VM/BeagleBone AI-64.

Included Docker image is intended to be used for compilation. This repo also includes a vscode
configuration for using the Docker image as a dev container.

**Warning: the code in this repo _does not work_. I'm making it available purely for academic
purposes. I'll update as I go.**
